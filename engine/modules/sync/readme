system stores:
- versions changes (event id and may loop)
- predicted events

on any change:
- store in system all adds, changes and removes to a system with note of version

on any event (local):
- change reconciliation version
- store all changes

on any event (server):
- if matches with predicted event we're good
- if doesn't match we revert latest changes and push event before predicted event
- if we have to many predicted events than we remove them all
