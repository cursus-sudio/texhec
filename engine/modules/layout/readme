ecs layout (show pseudo code in golang).
way of positioning groups of elements.

how would you define layout ?
how components would look like for parent and/or child ?

what about centering, aspect ratio (would it guess or rely on specified axis), min-max size, margins, order, wrapping and many others



okay now list responsibilities of layout system:
- positioning (including margin, padding and border, order, wrapping)
- content-sizing (including grow, shrink, min-max, aspect-ratio (use base axis or other more complex behavior))
where both of these responsibilities are heavily interconnected.
