This module is a nightmare to work with.
This module desperatly needs a refactor.

TODO before:
- extend ecs querying capabilities to overwrite track if component is already required
- allow to use ANDs and ORs

TODO:
- split camera definition and tools from smaller subsystems
- clear up package and move things to internal instead
- redo whole camera interface
- freestyle what i didn't wrote here down
