1. ```
what is needed:
- components recorded in prediction recording
- events predicted, sent from and to server

prediction recording:
- if there is latest prediction
- add components added, changed or removed to latest prediction

on client event:
- start new prediction recording
- send event to server
- predict
- if there is to many predictions remove them all and wait for real state
- stop prediction recording in wrap system

on event from server:
- pause prediction recording
- if matches first prediction then remove first prediction
- if doesn't match first prediction then
    revert all predictions
    apply this change
    apply all predictions again (removing all predictions and re-emitting events again to be recorded)
```

2. ```
on connection start load state and listen to changes.
on connection end notify user and remove predicting.

where there fits connection ?

type Stage uint8
const (
  _ Stage = iota
  Connected
  Verified
)

type ConnectionComponent struct {
  Conn *net.TCPCon
  Stage Stage // other permissions are in other components
}

```
