what are all steps of procedural generation ?
1. noise/noises

2. noise post processing (usually called filtering or remapping). examples:
- box blur
- noise smoothing

2. classification. classify noise/noises into game objects/height etc.

3. objects post processing.
- cellular automata
- flood fill
- distance fields
- erosion
- constraint solving
   we remove/move/transform things so our map will meet our constrains
